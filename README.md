# Exercise Monitoring Using OpenCV and Mediapipe
Unlike most common fitness apps available in the market, this app will make use of computer vision to monitor, analyze, and quantify physical excercises. Instead of just giving the user a set of routines, the app has the capability of understanding proper workout postures (eg. Situps). With that, the app can automatically count the reps if the user is following the proper workout posture for the given routine.
